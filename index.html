                                While I don't have an exact timeframe at the moment, please be assured that processing your refund is a top priority for us. As an intermediary of the airline, we are unable to confirm the refund timeframe, as we have to wait for the refund from the airline. 
                                Refunds typically undergo a thorough review process, which can vary based on several factors including payment method, bank processing times, and any specific policies related to your booking. 
                                Rest assured, we are actively working to expedite the process as much as possible. 
                                Our refund team will notify you via email once the refund is processed. 
                                You may also check the refund status on our website under the 'My Bookings' section. 
                                We appreciate your patience and truly value your business.

                                Refund timelines can vary, but we're here to ensure a smooth process! On average, it takes them 5 business days to process these, and once we receive those funds, our internal processing takes about 6 days. 
                                This means you can expect to see your refund within 10-15 business days. We're committed to transparency and will keep you informed every step of the way.

                                We totally get how frustrating it can be when things take longer than expected, and we're really sorry if this delay has caused any inconvenience to you. 
                                Rest assured, we're doing all we can to speed up this refund process. Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days. But sometimes, delays beyond our control can be caused. 
                                Thanks for bearing with us while we get this sorted. We genuinely appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.

                                We assure you that we are doing everything we can to make sure that the refund is processed as soon as possible,

                                The reason why you have not received the refund for the ticket is because we cannot start processing a refund until we have received the funds from the airline. 
                                You will be notified via a separate email as soon as the rest of the amount has been refunded. 
                                We totally understand your point of view, however, we would like to assure you that we have already taken all the necessary actions regarding your request

                                we have no influence over the airlines' prioritization from our end as they work with an extremely increased workload as well and have their own priorities to meet. 
                                As a result, the only option is for us to wait for the airline to finalize our request.

                                Appreciate your patience, On average, processing the refund by airline takes about 5 business days, 
                                followed by an additional 6 days for our internal handling. 
                                Therefore, you can expect to receive your refund within 10 to 15 business days. 
                                We are currently facing a high volume of refund requests, and are doing our best to prioritize based on their submission date and other factors.

                                While we can help with most inquiries, like itinerary changes and general questions, there are some cases where you'll need to contact the airline directly. 
                                This is due to airline policies that require their intervention. Rest assured, we’ll continue to support you in any way we can to ensure your trip goes smoothly.

                                We totally understand how frustrating it can be when things take longer than expected, and we're really sorry if this delay has caused any inconvenience to you. 
                                Rest assured, we're doing all we can to speed up this refund process. Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days. 
                                But sometimes, delays beyond our control can happen. Please kindly note, any extra delay might not be our fault—sometimes it's down to how quickly your bank processes the refund once we've sent it over. Thanks for bearing with us while we get this sorted. 
                                We genuinely appreciate your patience and understanding during this time. If you've got any other questions or need a hand with anything else, just let us know. We're here to help!

                                The price of a ticket is based on demand and set by the airline – the fare is higher for the date and time you are choosing than the ticket you originally paid for. 
                                If you are flexible, I can search for 2 to 3 different travel dates/times for a lesser fare difference.

                                3. The doctor's certificate must state the examination date, examination results, diagnosis and the fact that you are unable to travel.<br>
                                4. The doctor must use the Gotogate doctor's certificate (I will send the link via email): this is the only doctor's certificate we accept. 
                                The doctor's certificate must be printed by an independent party for the doctor's certificate to be valid.<br><br>

                                We totally get how frustrating it can be when things take longer than expected, 
                                and we're really sorry if this delay has caused any inconvenience to you. 
                                Rest assured, we're doing all we can to speed up this refund process. 
                                Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days. 
                                But sometimes, delays beyond our control can be caused.
